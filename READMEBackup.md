## Installation
In order to use this application you would simply clone this repository to your personal machine, download the neccessary packages (npm inquirer) (npm fs) (npm i) and be sure to have Node downloaded on your personal machine. Then the application will be ready to run in the terminal.

## Usage
To use this application simply open a terminal window for the repository and run "node index.js" (or just "node index"). You will then be prompted with a series of questions about your project such as its title and description, along with information about the user such as their Github profile name and email address. Answer each question as thoroughly as you would like it to appear in the final document but be aware that you can edit the README after it is complete. When you have completed all the questions it will ask if your project is held under a liscense. You may either select the liscense that applies or choose "none". An icon of the chosen liscense will appear at the top of the page as well as a note on which liscense is chosen at the bottom.
